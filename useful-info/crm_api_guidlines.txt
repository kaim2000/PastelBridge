CRM Side Changes:
2. Implement Incremental Sync (CRM portion)
Track last sync state (last document processed, timestamp)
Use the incremental sync endpoint instead of full data pulls
Handle cursor-based pagination properly
4. Pagination Controls (CRM adaptation)
Adapt to smaller page sizes (50-100 records instead of 5000)
Handle cursor-based pagination instead of offset-based
8. API Response Changes (CRM handling)
Read and use sync metadata from responses
Respect warning headers (retry-after, preferred schedule times)
Handle partial results gracefully
Both Sides Need Coordination:
2. Implement Incremental Sync
API: Provide endpoint for date-based incremental sync with document number cursor
CRM: Maintain sync state and use the incremental endpoint properly
The majority of the work is on the API side to protect Pastel from excessive load. The CRM mainly needs to adapt to use the new incremental sync approach and respect the more restrictive limits and pagination.
